
LUXURY LOAN DASHBOARD
by M. Asadullah Al Ghozi

This is a luxury loan dashboard that presents information about loan in luxury property.
Data used in this dashboard originally comes from LuxuryLoanPortfolio.csv and I do a pre-processing with Excel first. Thus, I use loan_ready.csv

The dashboard is written in R with deployment in Shinyapps.io. In processing, I use several packages (dplyr, shiny, ggplot, plotly, and etc).

Follow this step to open the dashboard on your local:
1. Download the Code, and Extract

2. Open one out of three (server.R, ui.R, or global.R)
3. Click Run App 

This dashboard is still basic and need improvement.

Thank you
